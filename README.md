This is for the finale project of Machine Learning. Major of Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence at Centro de Investion en Ciencias (UAEM)
Created by Cristopher Axel Diaz Martinez.
# Purpose

**The purpose of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Accurate stock price predictions can help investors make informed decisions, identify trends, and potentially increase their returns.**

# Objective

**Predict Future Stock Prices:** Develop an LSTM-based model to predict future closing prices of a specific stock based on historical closing prices. 

**Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess the performance of the LSTM model using appropriate metrics and compare it with baseline models. 

**Provide Insights:** Generate insights from the predictions and understand the limitations and potential of using LSTM for stock price forecasting.
